# Unauthorized-Parking-Identifier

We usually see vehicles get parked in the no parking areas which increases traffic drastically and police have to manually capture vehicles numberplate as this is 
not possible everytime.So we thought of "UNAUTHORISED PARKING IDENTIFIER(UPI)".

To avoid parking of vehicles in no parking zone. This device detects the vehicle number plates through the camera. 
Later on, sends the message to the respective email regarding the fine by using database, this reduces the traffic and saves valuable time , fuel and soon.
